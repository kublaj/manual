Automatic Source Code Checking (Linting)
========================================

Zed provides syntax and semantic checks for various languages out of the box. For instance:

* For JavaScript it includes JSHint, which provides hints of undeclared variables, missing semi-colons etc.
* For CSS it includes CSSHint, which will mark errors and warnings about your CSS code.
* For PHP, Lua and CoffeeScript it includes a parser that will mark syntactic errors.

Files are checked on-the-fly, as you type. Warnings and errors are marked either inline or in the gutter showing a little icon. Hover over the icon to show what the error or warning message is.
