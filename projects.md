Zed Projects
============

Zed is an editor based on projects. When you do a fresh Zed install, a few project-like options will be available, depending on the version of Zed these may include "Open Local Folder", "Open Dropbox Folder", "Notes", "Configuration", and "Manual".

Editing Local Files
-------------------
To edit the files in a folder on your local hard drive pick "Open Local Folder". A new Zed window will open allowing you to select the folder to edit. After you switch back to the Zed Project Picker window, you will see that the folder you just opened has been added to your project list.

Editing Files on Dropbox (Chrome App only)
------------------------------------------
To edit files on Dropbox, select "Open Dropbox Folder", login with Dropbox and select the folder to edit. After you opened the folder and switching back to the Project Picker, you'll notice that the folder you just openened has been added to your project list.

Notes (Chrome App only)
-----------------------
Notes is a special built-in project that stores its files on Google Drive and is automatically synced between all computers with Zed installed in, signed into the same Google Account.

Renaming a Project
------------------
By default Zed will use a project's path, or part thereof as a project name. The project name appears in the editor's title bar as well as in the recent projects list. To rename a project, you can do so from within the editor using the `Project:Rename` command (you can run this command by pressing `Command-.` on Mac or `Ctrl-.` on other OSes).

Deleting a Project
------------------
If you like you can manually delete projects from the list of recent projects simply by having the project highlighted and pressing the `Delete` key.
