Zed: The Manual
===============

Welcome to Zed's manual. As you can probably tell, this manual is hosted in a
regular Zed window, although all files are read-only. You can use all regular
navigation keys to navigate this manual, for instance using `Navigate:Goto` to open the goto box to quickly jump to a topic. Specific to this manual is that you can run commands listed with backticks by either clicking them, or moving your cursor there and pressing `Enter`. Similarly, when you click or press `Enter` on a navigation link, you'll immediately jump there.
