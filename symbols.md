Symbol Indexing
===============

Zed has its own symbol indexing infrastructure used for navigation and code completion.

Keys:

* `Command-R`: jump to a symbol within the current file
* `Command-J` jump to a symbol in the current project
* `Command-Shift-J`: jump to the symbol under the cursor searching for definitions
  within the current project.
